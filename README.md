# LOL-Checker

Thanks for checking my League Of Legends Stat Checker

Its my first python programm made with python, so any feedback would be highly appreciated!

To use it, run the LoLStatChecker.py on and editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

For the API key head to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and copy the Development API key.
